<h2>Reproducibility</h2>
<p>
    Two technical replicates of HCC1143 (two distinct libraries from one sample), a 100% purity tumor, were used to assess the repeatability of GATK in the context of the current sequencing process.  Each replicate is used as a case sample for this assessment.  The 2D histogram below was created by comparing segment means at each target.  This evaluation is attempting to quantify the noise of the entire pipeline, from sequencing through the generation of the copy ratio profile.  Ideally, all results would lie on the y=x line and RMSE would be zero.

<h4>Reproducibility Summary</h4>

<ul>
    <li>The RMSE of the targets (at positions < 3*ploidy) must be below threshold</li>
    <li>The Call Concordance must be above threshold</li>

<h2>HCC1143T Purity Series</h2>
<p>To assess the analytical sensitivity of the GATK CNV caller (amp/del) as a function of purity, varying purities of a well-characterized tumor cell line sample (HCC1143) and its matched normal (HCC1143BL) were used as case samples.</p>
<p>Ground truth was derived from JaBbA absolute copy number calls on a 2x250 WGS PCR free bam file of HCC1143.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Ground truth calls were determined as follows: <ul>
        <li>Absolute copy number of 0-2: Deletion</li>
        <li>5 or above: Amplification</li>
        <li>3 or 4: Neutral</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>"Ground-truth targets" are targets that overlapped an absolute copy number call in the ground truth.</li>
    <li>Sensitivity:  N = number of ground-truth targets</li>
    <li>Precision:  N = number of targets in called segments</li>
</ul>

<h2>Clinical Sensitivity</h2>
<p>The sensitivity (by base pairs) of the GATK calls was calculated for each of the five TCGA tumor samples.  Sample SM-74P5I (TCGA-55-8615-01A-11D-2389-01) failed QC metrics, but is included.</p>

<h2>WGS Concordance</h2>
<p>Concordance against the PCAWG Pilot consensus copy number estimates that have been converted to copy ratio, based on PCAWG consensus purity and ploidy estimates.</p>
<p>From the PCAWG website regarding the ground truth:</p>
<blockquote>This is the result of a procedure developed to obtain consensus copy number across 6 individual CNA callers: ABSOLUTE, ACEseq, Battenberg, CloneHD, JaBbA and Sclust. We first ran all methods across all samples with the consensus SVs included and applied an algorithm across the segmentations to obtain consensus breakpoints. With these mandatory breakpoints the methods were rerun without calling any additional breakpoints.


Samples for which the methods disagreed on the ploidy have gone through an adjustment algorithm that applies various ploidy adjustments in order to maximise the agreement and were assessed through a rigorous review procedure. After obtaining consensus on the ploidy segments are considered individually to assign copy number states: Clonal agreement (3 stars), majority vote agreement and agreement after rounding subclonal copy number (2 stars) and a call from the best method on that sample (1 star). This finally yields a complete, clonal copy number profile.

<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Red rows indicate a high mean absolute deviation/error from the ground truth segments.  Lower is better.  Threshold for red mark: {{ bp_concordance_mad_germline_filtered_threshold }}</li>
    <li>Dark red rows indicate that the sample is not likely to be useful for testing.</li>
    <li>The gray box is excluded data from all calculations (even excluded in total bp and MAD calculations).</li>
